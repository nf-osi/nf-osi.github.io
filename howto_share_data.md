# How to Share Your Data on the NF Data Portal

If you would like to submit data to the [NF Data Portal](https://nf.synapse.org/), steps to do so are outlined below. Please note that if your project has been funded by one of our [partners](https://nf.synapse.org/#Our%20Partners), we will be in touch with you, and you may have additional obligations to fulfill beyond the steps below, such as attending onboarding.

## Data Sharing Step-by-Step
1. **Become a [certified Synapse user](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html)**. This involves:
- [Creating an account](https://www.synapse.org/register)
- [Taking a short quiz to be certified](https://www.synapse.org/#!Quiz:Certification)
- [Linking your ORCID account to your profile](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/user_profiles.html)  (_optional, but recommended_) 
2. **Complete a [data sharing plan (DSP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4n5tIqnNk0aCp80AMWS69TzwXkEgRHYCuXWui8V_YU/edit)**. (Note: Some DSPs are tailored to specific funders, including [CTF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fhtjpvq1r4-QqB9YjG5KICW4pPDtRQpKkdlhPN1xMbk/edit?usp=sharing), GFF - [GTI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXqEarjrlz6XonXoxrwdUIT8Q-qfpIEYGFrY3g7lmgk/edit) and [VRI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JC8eNOS2bnrpIJhEX3zqLmqYTHUDF7Ui7xe139kBcCU/edit?usp=sharing), [NTAP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aa7061ekrk5qbFVnB7pRahnN1hDd0Ut_090QzdP0UyU/edit), and [DHART-SPORE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ib4RreL_UL7AC7NKgKFIu_8PBvJDeQxfNN7qDHh4GfI/edit?usp=sharing).)
3. If your data are already generated and ready for public release, ensure that:
- You have the appropriate permission and authority to do so (such as Institutional Review Board approval, informed consent, etc.). If you need to place [conditions for use (access restrictions)](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/access_controls.html#toc-conditions-for-use) on your data, please let us know (and be sure to detail them in your data sharing plan during step #2).
- Your data are annotated with metadata. (Note: we may ask you to validate your metadata, and will provide information about this process at the time.) 
4. Once you’ve completed the steps above, **send an email to [nf-osi@sagebionetworks.org](mailto:nf-osi@sagebionetworks.org) with the following information:**
- **Your Synapse user ID**
- **Your completed DSP**
- **Project title and abstract** (_Note: this will appear on the [NF Data Portal](https://nf.synapse.org/)._)
- **Any additional project contributors/authors**, if not detailed in DSP (_Note: to access the data, they will need to create an account; to upload data, they will need to be certified -- see step #1_)
- **Any supplementary materials** you want to include with the data, such as publications, code, etc.
- If applicable, additional info from step #3 above
5. Once we receive your information, we’ll review your submission, and (if approved) work with you to deposit your data in Synapse. Once all data is deposited and the embargo period ends, we'll share your data on the [NF Data Portal](https://nf.synapse.org/). 

## Data Sharing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Why should I be certified on Synapse, and what does that involve?
If you'll be uploading data to your project, you must become [certified](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html#getting-certified) on Synapse before doing so. Certification requires the completion of a [short quiz](https://www.synapse.org/#!Quiz:Certification), which  ensures you have awareness of privacy and security issues associated with using a platform that stores human subjects research data. 

### Why do I have to submit a data sharing plan (DSP)?
A DSP helps the NF Data Portal's data curation team prepare for your data intake, so they can better assist you with your project. DSPs notify us of upcoming deadlines and whether data deposits will include sensitive data requiring access controls. They also indicate whether we need to prepare for new data types by extending our metadata dictionary to accomodate new attributes and terms. 

### What if I've already created a Synapse project with NF data I'd like to share on the portal? 
Please get in touch with us, and in addition to following the applicable steps above, send us the synID of your project.
